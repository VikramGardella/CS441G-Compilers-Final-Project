Name: Vikram Gardella

Course: CS441G

Assignment: Program F, Milestones C&D

Updates to provided files:

1. Ran patch for getnum on pstcode.cc so far but have not made myTests yet.
2. Added assign statement in getnum() implementation within pstcode.cc
3. Added if-then, if-then-else, for-loop(2 expressions, 1 statement),
for-loop (with 3 expressions, 1 statement), and repeat-until functionalities.


Execution:

bnfc -m -cpp new.cf
make
make -f Makefile.codegen
./Testnew aaaa.zp
./compiler aaaa.zp bbb.apm
./pstack/api bbb


Added features:

1. getnum() with variable assignment;
2. Can interpret and translate if-then control structure
3. Can interpret and translate if-then-else control structure
4. Can interpret and translate simple for-loop control structure
5. Can interpret and translate for-loop that allows internal variable
   instantiation control structure.
6. Can interpret and translate repeat-until control structure.
7. Global Variables

Bugs, not implemented features:

Real-world application/practicality:

Tasks similar to this programming assignment are important in the real
world when a programming languange gets an update and added features.
The old compiler(s) for the programming language would need to be updated
so they can interpet the added functionalities of the starting language
so that they can successfully translate them to end language. The
translation in this case was from the Z-plus language to p-code.
